Functional Description
This is a tool designed for extracting Sprites from Unity resources and compositing layered character images.

Usage Instructions
Place the tool in a folder containing Unity resources（ExportedProject）

Run the program; it will automatically locate Texture2D and Sprite resources.

Follow the prompts to select the desired expression combinations for compositing.

The compositing results will be saved in the output folder.

Supported File Structure
The Texture2D folder contains atlas PNG files.

The Sprite folder contains .asset definition files.

Prefab files contain coordinate and composition data.

Output
output_part/: Extracted Sprite components/parts.

output/: Composited character images.

Notes
Ensure sufficient disk space is available.

The program will automatically skip existing files.

Supports batch compositing of multiple expression combinations.
